# School Equipment Lending - React Frontend (Updated)

This frontend is designed for the School Equipment Lending assignment.

## Purpose
- Phase 1: Manual implementation (frontend + connect to your chosen backend)
- Phase 2: AI-assisted enhancements (document AI usage separately)

## What's inside
- React (Vite) frontend with role-based UI (student/staff/admin)
- Components for signup/login, equipment CRUD, loan requests, approvals
- Environment variable: `VITE_API_URL`
- Documentation templates for AI usage log and reflection

## Quick start
1. Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and update `VITE_API_URL` if needed.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

## Note to students
This repo is the **frontend** only. Implement backend APIs (Node/Flask/.Net/Java) for Phase 1, then create Phase 2 (AI-assisted) improvements and store both versions in GitHub as required.
